FOLDERS and FILE DESCRIPTION


Folder: Generate_data
Contain network file of Sioux Falls, EMA, Anaheim
Stored OD demand for SiouxFalls with 30% missing demand 

File Generate_OD: To generate OD demand matrix for cases where nodes and zones are equal and demand generated by uniform distribution given min and max demand value
File Generate_OD_zone: To generate OD demand matrix for networks where no of nodes not equal to no of zones, so OD demand variation obtained by scaling the base demand given by network trip file.

File Generate_UE: python code for standard UE generation for full network. To solve UE solution with Gurobi
File Generate_UE_link_removal: A single python pipeline, to remove small percentage links randomly from SiouxFalls, remove those links from the existing path and remove paths with missing links, and finally generate UE for the new network and path set
File Generate_Topology_Variations: A single pipeline to create variants of SiouxFalls network by randomly adding/removing links, find the paths for the new network, and finally solve UE using Gurobi.

File utils: contains functions to read network, solve UE solution
File check_OD: to verify the demand files generated, draw charts
File check_UE: to verify the solution solved by Gurobi, draw charts

Folder: Solution
To store UE solution solved by Gurobi for all networks
Output1: Gurobi solved UE solutions for SiouxFalls full network and input OD demand with missing 30%

Folder: Model
Contains the code of pre-processing data, transformer, and evaluating model.
multi: Code for multi-class network
single: Code for single-class network
multi_main.py: to run training and predicting for multi class network

single_main.py: to run training and predicting for for single network

single_main_network_test.py: to run training and predicting for for single network for the topological variation of SiouxFalls network
plotting.py: plotting charts

HOW TO USE:

The data for SiouxFalls [OD_Matrices, UE_Solutions and path set] are given for reference on how to run. In the same manner, data for EMA and Anaheim can be generated. Their network files are already included.

Running
1. Check file Generate_OD  to generate new demand. 
2. Then resolve the UE solution with your new demand using Generate_UE.

3. Train your model:

a) For single-class network:
Edit the parameters in file Model/single/single_params.py
In Anaconda Powershell Prompt, cd to folder Model, run: python single_main.py

b) For single class network to test on topological variations:
Edit the parameters in file Model/single/single_params_network_test.py
In Anaconda Powershell Prompt, cd to folder Model, run: python single_main_network_test.py


4. For multi-class network:
Edit the parameters in file Model/multi/multi_params.py
In Anaconda Powershell Prompt, cd to folder Model, run: python multi_main.py
